    "The k Nearest Neighbors method (kNN) is a very popular classification method, also sometimes used in regression tasks. It's one of the most understandable approaches to classification. Intuitively, the essence of the method is: look at the neighbors; the predominant ones indicate what you are. Formally, the basis of the method is the compactness hypothesis: if the distance metric between examples is introduced successfully, then similar examples are much more likely to be in the same class than in different ones."
